Hi, I am [@TwiggyBuffalo](https://github.com/TwiggyBuffalo). 👋 I am a Software Engineer at 🔵 [takealot.com](https://takealot.com) - South Africa’s largest, most innovative ecommerce retailer. I love tech and am keen as a bean to collaborate with you so please feel free to get in touch via my [Website](https://www.twiggybuffalo.dev) or on any other platform. In my free time you can find me in the mountains riding my dirtbike or grabbing a cold one with my mates. Cheers 🍻
